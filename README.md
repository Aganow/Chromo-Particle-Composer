# ChromoParticleComposer

The ChromoParticleComposer is a Python module designed for composing particles in chromodynamic physics. It provides a powerful framework for generating optimized particle compositions based on complex chromodynamic interactions.

## Features

- Compose particles: The module allows users to create particle compositions by optimizing the energy function that considers the chromodynamic interactions between particles.

- Customizable: The module provides flexibility by allowing users to specify the number of particles and dimensions for each particle. Additionally, users can define their own implementation for the calculation of chromodynamic interaction energy.

- Optimization: The ChromoParticleComposer utilizes the `minimize` function from SciPy to find the best particle composition that minimizes the energy function.

## Usage

1. Import the `ChromoParticleComposer` class from the module:

```python
from ChromoParticleComposer import ChromoParticleComposer
```

2. Create an instance of `ChromoParticleComposer` by specifying the number of particles and dimensions:

```python
num_particles = 10
num_dimensions = 3
composer = ChromoParticleComposer(num_particles, num_dimensions)
```

3. Invoke the `compose_particles` method to generate the optimized particle composition:

```python
best_compositions = composer.compose_particles()
```

4. Customize the `_calculate_interaction_energy` method in the module to reflect the specific chromodynamic physics and interactions.

## Example

Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of ChromoParticleComposer:

```python
from chromo_particle_composer import ChromoParticleComposer

# Create a ChromoParticleComposer instance
num_particles = 10
num_dimensions = 3
composer = ChromoParticleComposer(num_particles, num_dimensions)

# Generate the optimized particle composition
best_compositions = composer.compose_particles()

# Print the best particle compositions
print(best_compositions)
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
